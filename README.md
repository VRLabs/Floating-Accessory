A discrete floating object.

## Install guide

"Floating Accessory.prefab" should go to the base of your Unity scene, which will give it base Unity scaling.

Unpack the prefab by right-clicking it.

Place "Floating Accessory" at the base of your avatar.

Remove "Floating Target" outside of "Floating Accessory" and place it anywhere in your avatar's hierarchy. Adjust the transforms as you need.
