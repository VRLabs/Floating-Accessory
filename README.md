## How it works

* Three physbones are used to make an object move smoothly witht the user.
* A sub animator then moves one physbone up and down to give it a floating effect.

## Install guide

* Drag & Drop the ``Floating Accessory`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* Expand the prefab hierarchy and find ``Floating Target``
* Move ``Floating Target`` outside of ``Floating Accessory`` and place it anywhere in your avatars hierarchy as needed.

## How to use

* Place the objects you want to float inside ``Container``.
  * Alternatively you can constrain the objects to ``Container``.

## Performance stats

```c++
Constraints:        6
